Dauqu - Docker-based Deployment Panel
Dauqu is a web-based panel that simplifies the deployment process for full-stack web applications. It utilizes Docker to manage backend and frontend code, databases, files, and other components, and provides an intuitive interface for server and Docker management, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

Getting Started
To use Dauqu, you will need a server with Docker installed. You can either install Docker on your own server or use a cloud-based service such as AWS or Digital Ocean.

Once you have a server with Docker, you can follow these steps to set up Dauqu:

Clone the Dauqu repository to your server
Edit the config.json file to configure your server settings
Run docker-compose up -d to start the Dauqu containers
Once Dauqu is running, you can access the panel by visiting your server's IP address or domain name in your web browser. The default username and password are "admin" and "password" (without quotes), respectively.

Usage
Once you have logged into Dauqu, you can use the panel to manage your projects, servers, Docker containers, and other components. The main dashboard provides an overview of your server and Docker resources, including CPU, memory, and disk usage.

You can add new projects and servers, manage files and databases, and configure proxy and SSL settings using the intuitive interface. Dauqu also provides real-time monitoring and logging, so you can easily troubleshoot issues and scale your Docker containers as needed.
